Wi-Fi Controlled Car with Ground Clearance Monitoring
This project implements a Wi-Fi controlled car using an ESP8266 microcontroller. The car can be operated through a web interface and features an ultrasonic sensor to monitor and display the ground clearance in real-time.

Features
Wi-Fi Connectivity: Control the car remotely via a web interface hosted on the ESP8266.
Motor Control: Move the car forward, backward, left, and right using four motor control pins.
Ground Clearance Monitoring: An ultrasonic sensor measures and displays the ground clearance in real-time on the web interface.
Responsive Web Interface: User-friendly interface with buttons for controlling the car and a display for ground clearance data.
Components
ESP8266 microcontroller
DC motors and motor driver
Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
Power supply
Wi-Fi network
Setup and Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wifi-controlled-car.git
cd wifi-controlled-car

Open the project in your Arduino IDE:

Ensure you have the ESP8266 board package installed. (Go to File > Preferences and add http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json to the "Additional Boards Manager URLs" field, then go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager and install the "esp8266" package.)
Open the wifi-controlled-car.ino file in the Arduino IDE.
Update the Wi-Fi credentials:

Replace the placeholder SSID and password in the code with your own network credentials:
cpp
Copy code
const char* ssid = "Your_SSID";
const char* password = "Your_PASSWORD";
Upload the code to the ESP8266:

Connect your ESP8266 to your computer and select the appropriate board and port from the Tools menu.
Upload the code to the ESP8266.
Usage
Once the code is uploaded and the ESP8266 is connected to your Wi-Fi network, open a web browser and enter the IP address displayed in the Serial Monitor.
Use the web interface to control the car's movements and view the ground clearance.
HTML Interface
The web interface includes:

Buttons for controlling the car's movement: Forward, Backward, Left, Right, and Stop.
A display for real-time ground clearance data.
